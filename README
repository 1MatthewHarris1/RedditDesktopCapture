Reddit Desktop Capture (RDC) is a program for MacOSX which collects images
from the social networking site "Reddit" and modifies them for use as
desktop background images. 

RDC has not been thoroughly tested on Windows and may not behave predictably.
Currently RDC is built to run on MacOSX exclusively. 

Required Packages:

	Pillow
	webcolors
	numpy
	AppKit

RDC will collect the images from the user specified subreddits and modify them
according to the user settings. Once modified, these images will be stored in
the local directory. The RDC directory hierarchy is as follows:

	Downloaded/ 		<- Contains base images that were downloaded
	Downloaded/Wallpapers/	<- Contains formatted images
	Downlaoded/Invalid/ 	<- Contains images that are invalid by resolution

When in the settings menu, pressing "Save Profile" button will save the current
state of the user settings. When the program is closed and reopened, the settings
will be the same as when the user left them. Launching the program will
automatically save the profile settings. 

The "Download Interval" setting currently has no function as the associated 
functionality of setting a system timer and service was deemed too far outside the
scope of the project. The setting will, however, still be "remembered" between
sessions provided the user saves the profile before exiting.

The "Profile Name" setting currently has no function but will in the future be used
to distinguish between preset profile configurations. This value will also be
"remembered" between sessions.
